                    Highly motivated, self-starting developer seeking to launch a career building web applications and services. With some introductory online Javascript 
                    classes in 2014, I was hooked into the world of software development. The interest in software led me to become a WordPress developer, then a Jr QA which 
                    helped me understand workflows to testing software. In 2018, I enrolled in Lambda for an immersive full-stack course. Upon graduating I was offered a 
                    Team Lead position to help the next cohort of students in their journey of software development. As a result, I was hired by Mobile Wash to contribute to 
                    develop Frontend, Backend features and help release app updates every 2-3 weeks with QA support.
